# Phishing Website Detection Model

This repository contains a PyTorch Lightning implementation of a phishing website detection model. The model is designed to classify screenshots of websites as either benign or phishing using state-of-the-art pre-trained vision models.

## Overview

The model was developed using **PyTorch Lightning**, which provides a lightweight wrapper around PyTorch to facilitate structured code and experimentation. We leveraged the **timm** library for its extensive collection of pre-trained models and optimized architectures, allowing us to implement cutting-edge vision models with ease.

### Key Features
- **Pre-trained Models**: Utilizes various pre-trained models from the `timm` library, ensuring high performance in image classification tasks.
- **Easy Experimentation**: PyTorch Lightning framework allows for easy configuration and experimentation.
- **Transfer Learning**: The model is designed with transfer learning principles, allowing rapid adaptation to the phishing detection task.
